🐾 The "Manifesto"

This add-on was not created for the masses. It was not created for "growth hacking," "monetization," or "market disruption."

It was created because a specific, unnamed "asinine change" made typing a simple email address a chore. I got tired of it. I got frustrated. And then, I got coding.

This is a niche product.

    Target Audience: Me.

    Secondary Audience: Maybe three or four friends who are also tired of this nonsense.

    Potential Market Share: Approximately 0.0000001% of the internet.

🐱 Features

    Zero Effort: Automatically inserts your email address so your fingers don't have to.

    Signed by Mozilla: It’s passed the gatekeepers. It’s official. It’s clean.

    Cat Approved: This extension was built under the watchful, judgmental eyes of the felines pictured above. They have reviewed the code and found it lacks treats, but functions flawlessly.

🐈 Why the Cats?

The cats represent the philosophy of this add-on:

    They do what they want.

    They do not care about "Industry Standards."

    If they find a process inefficient (like a closed door or a slow email entry), they will make enough noise to change the world.

Created by a human who just wanted things to work. Approved by the Cats.
